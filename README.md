# Stockportfolio

An Angular2 application that shows how to use Angular2 animations in the context of a simple stock portfolio dashboard. This repository contains the dashboard and the animations.

## How to run the code

* Clone this repository, then run `npm install` to install app dependencies
* There is a step by step branching in place. Each branch corresponds to a chronological progression of building the app and shows different animations
* To view each step, checkout the branch corresponding to the step, for instance, to checkout the first step, you'll want to run `git checkout part0`, and for the next step `git checkout part1` and so on.
* When you checkout a branch as detailed above, you can then install dependencies with `npm install`, following which you should run `ng serve` to start the development server, see further instructions below.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.26.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
