# Stockportfolio

An Angular2 application that shows how to use Angular2 animations in the context of a simple stock portfolio dashboard. This repository contains the dashboard and the animations.

## How to run the code

* Clone this repository, then run `npm install` to install app dependencies
* There is a step by step branching in place. Each branch corresponds to a chronological progression of building the app and shows different animations
* To view each step, checkout the branch corresponding to the step, for instance, to checkout the first step, you'll want to run `git checkout part0`, and for the next step `git checkout part1` and so on.
* When you checkout a branch as detailed above, you can then install dependencies with `npm install`, following which you should run `ng serve` to start the development server, see further instructions below.
